on top of the arduino mega is the DMX SHIELD CTC-DRA-10-R2 
(make sure you pressed it in well enough to make sure all pins make good contact)

because it is mechanicaly impossible to stack the LCD shield with buttons on top of it, the wires are extended
PIN1 TO PIN1
PIN2 TO PIN2
PIN3 TO PIN3.....
5V TO 5V
GND TO GND

from Arduino Mego to the relay board: 
GND from powersupply 5V GND 
5V from powersupply to VCC from relay board
PIN 22 TO IN1
PIN 24 TO IN2
PIN 26 TO IN3
PIN 28 TO IN4
PIN 30 TO IN5
PIN 32 TO IN6
PIN 34 TO IN7
PIN 36 TO IN8

connect 5VDC powersupply to the arduino mega.
